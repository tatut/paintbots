# Paintbots!

A collaborative canvas where participants program "bots" that move on the canvas and color in cells.
The server contains a web UI to watch the canvas in (near) realtime to see how the art is being generated.

The server will also periodically save a PNG of the canvas that can be turned into a video at the end of
a session.

## Running

Start by running `clojure -m paintbots.main`. Then open browser at http://localhost:31173

See bots folder for sample bots using simple bash scripts.

Alternatively, you can run local server using Docker without needing to install Clojure:
`docker run -p 31173:31173 antitadex/paintbots:latest`

## Bot commands

Each bot must be registered to use. All bot commands are POSTed using simple form encoding to
the server. See bots folder `_utils.sh` on how it uses curl to post commands.

| Command  | Parameters      | Description                                                                             |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| register | register=name   | register a bot with the given name (if not already registered), returns id              |
| info     | id=ID&info      | no-op command that just returns bots current                                            |
| move     | id=ID&move=DIR  | move from current to position to direction DIR, which is one of LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN |
| paint    | id=ID&paint     | paint the current position with the current color                                       |
| color    | id=ID&color=COL | set the current color to COL, which is one of 0-f (16 color palette)                    |
| msg      | id=ID&msg=MSG   | say MSG, displays the message along with your name in the UI                            |
| clear    | id=ID&clear     | clear the pixel at current position                                                     |
| look     | id=ID&look      | look around, returns ascii containing the current image (with colors as above)          |
| bye      | id=ID&bye       | deregister this bot (id no longer is usable and name can be reused)                     |
| bots     | id=ID&bots      | return (JSON) information about all registered bots                                     |

Register command returns just the ID (as plain text) for future use. All other commands return your
bot's current position and color.

### Using WebSockets

If you prefer, you can also connect via WebSocket. The API is the same, but instead of sending each
command as a separate HTTP request, you connect with the canvas URL. The server expects a text message with
the same form encoded format and sends the response back as a text message.

The commands are the same, but register only returns "OK" instead of an id. Id parameter is not required
as the id is implicit in the WebSocket connection. The bot is automatically deregistered when the connection
is closed.

## Deployment

See azure/README.md for instructions on how to deploy to Azure cloud. You can also easily deploy to
any cloud provider that supports hosting Docker images.


## Configuration

The default parameters in `config.edn` file are enough for most cases, but it is **highly** recommended
to change at least the admin password.

Notable configuration options:

* `:width` and `:height` affect the canvas size (320x200 or 160x100 are good to have something visible, bigger canvas will use more memory also)
* `:command-duration-ms` affects how long the processing of a single command will take at minimum (to prevent flooding with commands)
* `:password` admin UI password

See `config.edn` for full configuration with suitable sample values.

## Endpoints

HTTP endpoints in the running software:

* `GET /admin` the admin UI that lets you create/clear canvases and kick players (see above for configuring password)
* `GET /<canvas>` view a canvas with given name
* `POST /<canvas>` post a bot command to the given canvas

The canvas name in URL can only contain letters and the root path is a canvas named "scratch".
A canvas cannot be named "admin".

## Logo-like language

The UI includes a Logo-like language interpreter that can be used through the browser (tested with Chrome).
The evaluation uses the same API as all other bots, via the browser's `fetch`.

To start the interpreted, view the canvas page and add URL parameter `?client=1`.
For examples on programs see `logo.md` file in this repository.
